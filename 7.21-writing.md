## 比较类

指出问题
The author commits the fallacy of "all things are equal".  
The author's conclusion bases on false analogy.  
The argument rests on the assumption that A is analogous to/similar/identical to B in all respects.  

分析问题（指出不同）  
This assumption is weak, since although   
there are points of comparison between A and B, there are many dissimilarties/differences as well. For example, A...; however, B... .  

段落总结
In short, without accounting for important possible differences between A and B, the arguer cannot resonably/plausibly prove the proposed method 根据具体题目确定will help A.  


- 错误类比 (False analogy)
句式积累
指出问题
The arguer simply assumes that..., but he does not provide any evidence that A and B are indeed comparable.  
分析问题
As we know, ...differ conspicuously. It is true that both ... and ..., but there exist fundamental differences: ...
段落总结
Therefore, even though ... proved effective in A, there is no guarantee that it will work just as well for B. 

- 横向比较纵向比较混淆（confusing comparison and variation)  
质疑方法：列举使用另一种比较的可能结果。


- 不完整比较（Incomplete comparison)  
质疑方法：列举作者未比较的方面  
句式表达积累：  
指出问题：  
The author hastily implies that ... is superior to ... in ..., but the comparison between ... and ... is incomplete.   
分析问题：  
The author only compares ...; however, there are a myriad of factors which, if differ in these cases, would bring about totally different result for the comparison. For example, ... .  
段末总结：  
Without any further consideration about these factors, the author could not convince us that ... is better than ... in merely based on an incomplete comparison.  

- 时间推测  
过去推现在，过去推将来，现在推将来，现在推过去（极少）  
质疑方法：列举这段时间内的变化因素  
句式表达积累：  
现在推将来
摘引原文存疑部分
The author claims that 将来, because 现在/过去  
指出问题：  
This assumption is unwarranted because things rarely/seldom/barely remain the same/unchanged/constant/unaltered over extended period of time.  
分析问题：  
There are likely all kinds of differences between 过去 and 将来. For example, 现在; however, 过去.  
段落总结：  
Any of these scenarios, if true, would serve to undermine the claim that ... .  

现在推将来句式积累:  
The auguer unfairly assumes that there will be no significant change in ... in the future.  
The author assumes without justification that the trends of ... will continue in the future.  

过去推现在
指出问题：  
The arguer's inference is that ... which worked so well to ... in the past will surely be of equal benefit in the future rests on the poor assumption that during ... all the conditions upon which ... depends have remained unchanged.  
分析问题：  
The arguer overlooks the possibility that ... would ..., or that ... would ... .   
段落总结：  
Without taking into account these possibilities, the arguer's recommendation that ... is flimsy.  

## 因果类  

1.  时间与因果关系  
Post hoc, ergo proper hoc  
(after this, therefore because of this) 时序**先后**因果关系错误  
提出问题：  
Based on the fact that ... occur after..., the argument infers that ... should be responsible for/result in/contribute to/trigger/bring about/lead to ... .  
分析问题（列举他因）：  
However, the sequence of these events, in itself, does not guarantee that the former caused the latter one. It might have resulted from/attributed to/ascribed to some other factors instead. To just list/name a few possibilities... 列举他因. 
段落总结：  
Without ruling out scenarios such as these, the arguer cannot establish a cause-and-effect/casual relationshop between__ and __ upon which the recommendation depends.  

提出问题：  
The author assumes that A caused B.  
分析问题：  
The line of the reasoning is that because A before B, the former event caused the latter. But this is fallacious reasoning unless other possible causal explanations have been considered and ruled out. For example, perhaps A1 is the cause of these events or perhaps B is caused by A2.  
段落总结：  
Without ruling out scenarios such as these, the arguer cannot establish a cause-and-effect/casual relationship between __ and __ upon which the recommendation depends.  

2.  **同时**因果错误 （Concurrence)

提出问题：  
Merely a concurrence of ... and ... does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between them.  
Merely a coincidence of two evnets could not sufficiently demonstrate a causal relationshop between them.  
The arguer may confuse concurrence with causality.  

段落总结：  
Without ruling out such factors, we could not be convinced that is the actual cause of and consequently the final conclusion based on the causal relationship is unjustified.

例句同上  

4.  非此即彼类谬误 （false dilemma / either-or fallacy)  

指出问题：  
The author's recommendation/conclusion rests on the unlikely/unconvincing/unpersuasive ssumption that ... has only two alternatives/results that ...  
分析问题：  
In all likelihood, ... can engage one of many other ... instead.  
段落总结：  
Thus, to some extent the author recommends that ... either ... or ... is unwarranted.  

## 范围类

范围类推理错误 changing scopes  
质疑方法： 列举不同范围的差异  

1.  以偏概全  
指出问题：  
The argument resets on the assumption that 个体案例 typify 整体情况.  

分析问题：  
If this is not the case, then it is entirely possible that 在另一个地方，上述个案的结果不会发生相同的情况。  

段落总结：  
Thus, lacking more information about __ nationwide, it is difficult to assess/evaluate the merit of the recommendation.  

2.  以全概偏  
指出问题：  
One problem with the argument is that is assumes that the nationwide(characterictics/traits/features of a group apply to/be applicable to/be true of every member of that group)  
statistics about ___ applies equally to 局部的/个体成员  

分析问题（列举他因）  
Yet this might not be the case, for a variety/myriad of/numerous possible reasons. Perhaps, ___; or perhaps .... .
