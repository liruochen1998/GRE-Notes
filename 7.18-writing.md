### 段落总结

Without ruling out these possible scenarios, the author cannot resonably rely on these statistics to support the claim.

In short, without sufficient evidence to substantiate the assumption/the survey is trustworthy, the arguer's recommendation is unconvincing.

## Do the statistics make any difference?

Weak point:   
**The author treats a lack of proof that** something is the case **as constituting sufficient proof that it is not the case**. (Does the survey make any difference?)


One possible body paragraph:  
**The argument treates a lack of proof that**  
**as constituting sufficient proof that**  
**the arguer overlooks the possibility that**  
**Without ruling out this scenario, the arguer cannot justify the conclusion**
